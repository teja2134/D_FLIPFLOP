# D_FLIPFLOP

# AIM:

To simulate and synthesis D flipflop using vivado.

# Apparatus Required:

vivado 2023.2 software.

# Procedure:

STEP:1 Start the vivado software, Select and Name the New project.

STEP:2 Select the device family, device, package and speed.

STEP:3 Select new source in the New Project and select Verilog Module as the Source type.

STEP:4 Type the File Name and module name and Click Next and then finish button. Type the code and save it.

STEP:5 Select the run simulation and then run Behavioral Simulation in the Source Window and click the check syntax.

STEP:6 Click the simulation to simulate the program and give the inputs and verify the outputs as per the truth table.

STEP:7 compare the output with truth table.

# VERILOG CODE:

module dff(d,clk,rst,Q);

input d,clk,rst;

output reg Q;

always @(posedge clk)

begin

if(rst==1)

Q=1'b0;

else

Q=d;

end

endmodule

# OUTPUT:

# RESULT:

Thus the verilog program for D flipflop has been simulated and verified successfully.
